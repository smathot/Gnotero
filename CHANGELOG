CHANGELOG

0.42
- Enabled ellipsize by default, to make sure that every result is the same size and
  that text doesn't spill over beyond the visible borders.
- Made live_search_time configurable, which indicates how fast Gnotero should autosearch
- Replaced the pdftk way of getting metadata with PyPDF, which is much faster
- Fixed a bug where Gnotero failed to open linked attachments

0.41
- Fixed window positioning so that the window is always within the screen boundaries (Linux).
  Patch provided by Thomas Jost.
- Made the window position configurable under Windows (and if attach_menu_to_icon = no under Linux)
- Disabled copying PDFs from within Gnotero (use Gnoterobrowse instead, works much better)
- Autoconfig now automatically adds comments to the .gnotero config file
- Gnotero now checks for updates automatically

0.40
- Started a systematic changelog :-)
- Gnotero now offers to locate Zotero automatically on the first run
- Migration to libzotero (from zoterotools) is complete

  rather than simply taking the first matching note
